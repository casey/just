### Invoking `justfile`s in Other Directories

If the first argument passed to `just` contains a `/`, then the following occurs:

1. The argument is split at the last `/`.

1. The part before the last `/` is treated as a directory. `just` will start its search for the `justfile` there, instead of in the current directory.

1. The part after the last slash is treated as a normal argument, or ignored if it is empty.

This may seem a little strange, but it’s useful if you wish to run a command in a `justfile` that is in a subdirectory.

For example, if you are in a directory which contains a subdirectory named `foo`, which contains a `justfile` with the recipe `build`, which is also the default recipe, the following are all equivalent:

````sh
$ (cd foo && just build)
$ just foo/build
$ just foo/
````
